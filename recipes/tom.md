<input type="checkbox" enabled /> 1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons cool water (65Â° F)<br>

### Sauce
<input type="checkbox" enabled /> 6 oz tomato paste <br>
<input type="checkbox" enabled /> 15 oz tomato sauce <br>
<input type="checkbox" enabled /> 1 Â½ tsp oregano (to taste) <br>

### Toppings

## Preparation

### Dough
####  Step 1
<input type="checkbox" enabled /> With a large metal spoon, stir together all the ingredients in a 4-quart bowl or the bowl of an electric stand mixer until combined. 

* _If mixing with an electric mixer,_ fit it with the dough hook and mix on low speed for about 4 minutes, or until all the flour gathers together to form a coarse ball. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then mix again on medium-low speed for an additional 2 minutes, or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl and sticks just a little to the bottom. If the dough is too soft and sticky to hold its shape, mix in more flour by the tablespoonful; if it is too stiff or dry, mix in more water by the tablespoonful. 
* _If mixing by hand,_ repeatedly dip one of your hands or the spoon into room-temperature water and use it much like a dough hook, working the dough vigorously into a course ball as you rotate the bowl with your other hand. As the flour is incorporated into the ball, about 4 minutes, the dough will begin to strengthen; when this occurs, let the dough rest for 5 minutes and then resume mixing for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, or until the dough is slightly sticky, soft, and supple. If the dough is too soft and sticky to hold its shape, mix in more flour by the tablespoonful; if it is too stiff or dry, mix in more water by the tablespoonful. <br>
